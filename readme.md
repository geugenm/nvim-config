ðŸ’¤ LazyVim Starter: Because Mediocrity is a Choice

A meticulously curated configuration template for those who understand that **code is not just syntax, but a philosophical statement**.

## ðŸ”¬ Intellectual Property Disclaimer

Licensed under Apache 2.0 - a license that, unlike most open-source licenses, doesn't force you into a communist code-sharing model. It's permissive. Much like my approach to software engineering: do what works, without unnecessary constraints.

**Key Apache 2.0 Features:**

- Commercial use? Absolutely.
- Modify at will? Obviously.
- Patent protection? Inherent.

## ðŸ§  Installation

```bash
# Clone. Adapt. Overcome.
git clone https://github.com/geugenm/nvim-config.git
cd nvim-config
```

Refer to [LazyVim Documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation)

## ðŸš€ Philosophy

This isn't just a configuration. It's a **statement**.

A declaration that your development environment is an extension of your cognitive capabilities, not a random assemblage of plugins chosen by committee.

**Minimal. Efficient. Ruthlessly Pragmatic.**
